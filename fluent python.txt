Container sequences
	list, tuple and collections.deque can hold items of different types.
	they store references to  physical value
Flat sequences
	str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview and array.array hold items of one type
	they store actual physical value

Another way of grouping sequence types is by mutability:
Mutable sequences
	list, bytearray, array.array, collections.deque and memoryview
Immutable sequences
	tuple, str and bytes

Tuples - immutable list and also records with no fields
